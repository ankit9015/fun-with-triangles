# fun-with-triangles

Fun with triangles website is a fun quiz game about triangles. It also has some cool calculators to find the hypotenuse of triangle and the area of the triangle.
The site also has a triangle checker that tells you if the three angles are forming a triangle.

The program is built using Vanilla JS, HTML and CSS.


I build this project as a part of a slew of projects in Neog.camp level zero curriculum. The program offers minimum hand holding and the available materials are enough to help whenever need arises.

Please visit my portfolio site for other such projects, I'll really appreciate and thank you for your time.
